# Section 9: Combining Function Concepts

Q1) Write a function generateMessage(name, score) that calculates whether the student has passed (score ≥ 40) and returns a complete sentence like: "Aarav has scored 65 and the result is Pass".

```js
function generateMessage(name, score){
    if (score>=40){
        return name+" has scored "+score+" and the result is Pass."
    }else{
        return name+" has scored "+score+" and the result is Fail."
    }
}
let res = generateMessage("Dhruv",98)
console.log(res)
```

Q2) Create a function billCalculator(item1, item2, item3) that returns the total amount and also mentions if the customer gets a discount (total ≥ 1000 → "Discount Applied", otherwise "No Discount").

```js
function billCalculator(item1, item2, item3){
    let total = item1+item2+item3
    if (total>=1000){
        return "Bill Amount is "+total+" Discount Applied."
    }else{
        return "Bill Amount is "+total+" No Discount."
    }
}
let res = billCalculator(563,234,342)
console.log(res)
```

Q3) Write a function performanceReport(student, m1, m2, m3) that calculates total and average, then returns a formatted string containing name, total, average and a remark ("Excellent" if average ≥ 80, otherwise "Keep Improving").

```js
function performanceReport(student, m1, m2, m3){
    let total = m1+m2+m3
    let avg = total/3
    let remark = avg>=80 ? "Excellent" : "Keep Improving"
    return `${student} got total ${total} marks making an average ${avg}. ${remark}`
}
let res = performanceReport("Quinny",76,78,89)
console.log(res)
```

Q4) Why is it better to perform multiple related tasks (calculation + decision + message) inside one function instead of writing separate pieces of code?

Answer: Performing multiple related tasks inside one function facilitates us to reuse same code by writing a single line for it and it keep the code clean and easy to understand. Writing separate pieces of code make it messier.

Q5) How does combining concepts like parameters, return and conditions inside a single function improve code quality?

Answer: Combining parameters, return statements and conditions inside a single function makes a code more reusable, organized and efficient. Parameters allow the function to accept conditions help make decisions and return provide result.
