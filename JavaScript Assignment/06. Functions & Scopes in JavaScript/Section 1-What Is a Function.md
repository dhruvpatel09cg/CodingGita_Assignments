# Section 1: What Is a Function?

Q1) Why do we use functions instead of writing the same code again and again? Explain with one simple example.

Answer: We use `function` to avoid writing same code again and again. It allows us to write a block of code once and reuse it whenever needed.

```js
console.log("Hello students!")
console.log("Hello students!")
console.log("Hello students!")
console.log("Hello students!")
// instead of this we can just use function and call it as needed

function greet(){
    console.log("Hello Students!")
}
greet()
greet()
greet()
greet()
```

Q2) List any four advantages of functions and write one line for each advantage.

Answer: 1. Code Reusability: Allows us to write code once and reuse multiple times.

2. Less Repetition: Avoid writing the same code again and again.

3. Easy to maintain: If we need a different output we can change the code once and all the outputs will be changed.

4. Better Organization: Makes code cleaner and easier to understand. Same code written repeatedly will make it messier.

Q3) Imagine you have to display a welcome message at 6 different places in your program. How will a function help you here?

Answer: Function let us write a code for welcome message once and reuse it 6 times instead of writing console six times.

```js
function welcome(){
    console.log("Welcome to CG")
}
welcome()
welcome()
welcome()
welcome()
welcome()
welcome()
```

Q4) Show the same code written twice without a function and once with a function.

```js
// Without Function
console.log("Good Morning!")
console.log("Good Morning!")

// With Function
function greet(){
    console.log("Good Morning!")
}
greet()
greet()
```

Q5) Give one real-life analogy that explains the idea of a function.

Answer: Function is like a washing machine, while making of it it's cycle is defined once, then whenever we use it, it repeats the same process every time.

Q6) Why do functions make debugging easier?

Answer: Function helps in finding errors especially. If an error occurs we just have to check the code in function only. Not the whole code.
